# get-nr-clusters-lca-taxonomy

This folder implements a Python script that takes a TSV of taxids and outputs a CSV that includes the original rows in the TSV along with the output of the commands of `taxonkit lca` and `taxonkit reformat`. The script is written to be run (and be parallelized) with [Modal Labs](https://modal.com/).

This folder uses conda to manage software environments and installations. You can find operating system-specific instructions for installing miniconda here. After installing conda and mamba, run the following command to create the run environment.

```
mamba env create --file environment.yml
mamba activate modal
```

Following this, you need to login to Modal:

```
modal token new
```

Then, run the script with:

```
modal run lca_taxonomy.py
```
